# Katelin M. Hudak

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Before coming to Johns Hopkins, I earned my PhD in Public Policy from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. 

My primary research interests focus on how policies affect health outcomes and well-being, particularly among children and other vulnerable subpopulations. My broader research program encompasses a variety of topics, centering on evaluating health disparities through quantitative analysis and causal inference techniques. Through my research, I aim to shed light on the effects of programs, and to inform policy to improve the health and well-being of children and minority groups.
